# SMS_Spam_Detector
****Goal of the project:**** Aim was to develop a web application utilizing machine learning and natural language processing to accurately identify and filter SMS spam messages, providing users with a seamless and secure messaging experience.

## Key Points:
+ Utilized NLP data preprocessing techniques, such as TF-IDF vectorization, to transform text data into numerical representations that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.
+ Developed a user interface for the machine learning model using Flask, a web development framework in Python, providing a seamless and interactive experience for users.
+ Employed Python and Keras, a deep learning framework, for constructing and evaluating the machine learning model used in the project.
+ Leveraged NLP techniques to effectively process and analyze textual data, enabling accurate identification and filtering of SMS spam messages.
+ Deployed the user interface using Flask, allowing users to interact with the machine learning model through a web application.
+ Utilized the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, a commonly used machine learning algorithm for text classification tasks, to address the problem of SMS spam detection.
+ Achieved an accuracy of 96.41% with the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, indicating its effectiveness in accurately classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
By employing NLP techniques, Python, Keras, and Flask, the project successfully developed a web application with a user-friendly interface for accurate identification and filtering of SMS spam messages. The utilization of the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm resulted in a high accuracy rate, contributing to an enhanced messaging experience for users.
